        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl">VAR:</h2>
            <p>
                A var variable has functional scope.That means it is present and accessible only within a function.Within the scope, it can be modified and redeclared.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl">LET:</h2>
            <p>
                A let variable has a block scope. It can be declared in a block, and it can be used only within that block.This variable is like var, which can be updated within its scope, but unlike var, which cannot be redefined within its scope.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl">CONST:</h2>
            <p>
                Variables declared with the const keyword keep their values constant. Const declarations are similar to let declarations. A const variable has a block scope.The const variable remains constant within its scope.It can't be changed or declared again.

        <h1 class="text-4xl text-center underline mb-3">The use cases of null and undefined</h1>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl">NULL:</h2>
            <p>
                Null is an object in JavaScript. It is the purposeful absence of value.It is one of JavaScript's primitive values.The value null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of nothing. 

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl">UNDEFINED:</h2>
            <p>
                Undefined indicates that a variable has been declared but no value has been assigned to it. It means the value does not exist in the compiler.It is the global object.It is a feature of ECMAScript1 (ES1).

        <h1 class="text-4xl text-center underline mb-3">REST(Representational State Transfer) API</h1>
        <p>
            An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how different applications or devices can connect to and communicate with one another. A REST API is an API that adheres to the REST, or representational state transfer, design principles. As a result, REST APIs are also referred to as RESTful APIs.
            <br>
            A RESTful API is an interface that allows two computer systems to securely exchange data over the internet.A RESTful API performs the same basic function as browsing the internet. When a resource is required, the client contacts the server via the API. In the server application API documentation, API developers explain how the client should use the REST API.
             <h6 class="font-semibold my-4">Some of the REST architectural principles are as follows:</h6>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>Uniform interface</li>
                <li>Layered system</li>
                <li>Cacheability</li>
                <li>Code on demand</li>
            </ul>

            <h6 class="font-semibold my-4">RESTful APIs offer the following advantages:</h6>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>Scalability</li>
                <li>Flexibility</li>
                <li>Independence</li>
